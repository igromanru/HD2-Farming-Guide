# Helldivers 2 Farming Guide by Igromanru
**Currently based on the Experimental Division Cheat Engine Table v4.0.0**  
I made an abridge version of the Experimental Division CT v4.0.0 for famring only.  
It contains only features that you need to farm Super Credits, Medals and Expirience.  

## Required resources
- HD2 ED Farming table
- My AutoIt PickUp Macro or similiar
- Understanding on how the game works

## General Information (Important!)
Hacking is not an exact science. Removing GameGuard from the game will sometimes cause it to crash. Also, some features might cause crashes under different circumstances.  
To reduce any friction, read the guide carefully and follow the steps.

## Super Credits Farming

## Medals and Expirience Farming

## AutoIt Macro
Part of the repo and the release includes a simple AutoIt macro script that presses the interaction key with the optimal order and timing to pick up as many Super Credits as possible, as quickly as possible.  



## Abridged ED CT
The CT that I provide contains only features that you need or are usefull for farming.  
You can activate the  `Enable All` script to enable all scripts you need to start farming Super Credits.  
But the `Samples, Exp and Medals scripts` section contains scripts for Medals and Expirience farming as werll.

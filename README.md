# Helldivers 2 Farming Guide by Igromanru

**The guide revolves around the abridged version of the released ED CT, compiled by me for farming**  
You need the "Farming" Cheat Engine Table from the [release](https://github.com/igromanru/HD2-Farming-Guide/releases) to follow the guide!
Which is an abridge version of the Experimental Division CT v4.0.0 (credits Zodiac).  
It contains only features that you need to farm Super Credits, Samples, Medals and Experience.  

## Required resources
- Basic understanding of how Cheat Engine wroks (watch video tutorials or something)
- [Cheat Engine 7.5](https://mega.nz/file/HNFRBSrY#rj4oel3UuK9hoj1BtezRVbGhNJBo8mQ3EYl7ioFprcc) or higher
- HD2 ED Farming table
- My AutoIt PickUp Macro or similar
- Installed [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) (if you want to use the script)
- Understanding on how the game works

## General Information (Important!)
Hacking is not an "exact science". Removing GameGuard from the game will sometimes cause it to crash. Also, some features might cause crashes under different circumstances.  
To reduce any friction, read the guide carefully and follow the steps.

## Super Credits Farming

*Text-based tutorial is on the ToDo list for later*

## Medals and Experience Farming

## AutoIt Macro
Part of the repo and the release includes a simple [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) macro script that presses the interaction key with the optimal order and timing to pick up as many Super Credits as possible, as quickly as possible.  
You can edit the script to change how many SC you want to pick-up per run, change the interaction key (default `F`) or the hotkey for the Macro (default: `o`, and default `CTRL+Q` to cancel the macro).


## Abridged ED CT
The CT that I provide contains only features that you need or are useful for farming.  
You can activate the  `Enable All` script to enable all scripts you need to start farming Super Credits.  
But the `Samples, Exp and Medals scripts` section contains scripts for Medals and Experience farming as well.  
I've signed the table with my own signature to allow users to use the option "Execute Lua script: `Only when signed, else ask`", which will execute the Lua script with GameGuard Bypass as soon you open the table.

[B][SIZE="3"]The guide is currently based on the last Experimental Division Cheat Engine Table v4.0.0 release[/SIZE][/B]
I made an abridge version of the [URL="https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/helldivers-2-a/717822-experimental-division-ct-game-guard-bypass.html"]Experimental Division CT v4.0.0[/URL] for farming only.  
It contains only features that you need to farm Super Credits, Medals and Experience.

[B][SIZE="3"]General Information (Important!)[/SIZE][/B]
Hacking is not an "exact science". Removing GameGuard from the game will sometimes cause it to crash. Also, some features might cause crashes under different circumstances.  
To reduce any friction, read the guide carefully and follow the steps.

[B][SIZE="3"]AutoIt Macro[/SIZE][/B]
Part of the repo and the release includes a simple AutoIt macro script that presses the interaction key with the optimal order and timing to pick up as many Super Credits as possible, as quickly as possible.  
You can edit the script to change how many SC you want to pick-up per run, change the interaction key (default `F`) or the hotkey for the Macro (default: `o`, and default `CTRL+Q` to cancel the macro).

[B][SIZE="3"]Abridged ED CT[/SIZE][/B]
The CT that I provide contains only features that you need or are useful for farming.  
You can activate the  `Enable All` script to enable all scripts you need to start farming Super Credits.  
But the `Samples, Exp and Medals scripts` section contains scripts for Medals and Experience farming as well.  
I've signed the table with my own signature to allow users to use the option "Execute Lua script: `Only when signed, else ask`", which will execute the Lua script with GameGuard Bypass as soon you open the table.
